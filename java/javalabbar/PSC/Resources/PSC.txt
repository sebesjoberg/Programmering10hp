        PSC rules
        =======

In PSC both players execute moves at exactly the same time. When one player makes a move it will only
be shown to the opponent when the opponent makes a move,and then both moves are executed simultaneously.

Piece moves
---------------

Pieces move as in chess with the exception that there is no notion of check.
Putting or leaving your king on an attacked square is allowed.
For winning conditions see below.


Controlled  squares
-----------------------

Squares can be *attacked* by several pieces.
A piece attacks the square where it sits, and any square it can move to
  (including captures), by the rules above.
You  *control* a square if you have strictly more pieces attacking it than the opponent.
Controlled squares are highlighted.
Hit the space bar to toggle highlighting of your or opponent's control.


PSC moves
--------------

A piece is *frozen* if it is attacked by two opponent pieces,
   i.e., it is on a square controlled by the opponent.
Frozen pieces of both players are shown on red squares.
Frozen pieces may not move.
A PSC move is a move by a mobile (not frozen) piece to a square controlled by the player.
    (A PSC castle move is a castle where both King and Rook are mobile,
     and their destinations are controlled.)
A PSC move may capture a frozen opponent piece (since that square is controlled).


Game end
------------

End conditions are resolved only when both players have moved.

A player wins by either freezing the opponent King, i.e., attacking the square where the opponent king sits
with at least two pieces, or by checkmating the opponent, i.e., attacking the opponent with at least one piece
and the opponent has no legal moves.

If both players simultaneously freeze the opponents' king or checkmate the opponent the game is a draw.

A player is stalemated if the player has no legal moves and the King is not attacked.
If one or both players are stalemated the game is a draw.
